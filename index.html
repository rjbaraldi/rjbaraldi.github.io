<p> I'm a current John von Neumann Postdoctoral Fellow at Sandia National Labs, working with Drew Kouri<a href="https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?dpkouri">Drew Kouri</a> and others in the Optimization & Uncertainty Quantification group at SNL.
    My primary focus is deterministic methods for non-smooth, non-convex problems in optimization.
    I finished my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington under Aleksandr Aravkin<a href="https://uw-amo.github.io/saravkin/">Aleksandr Aravkin</a>.
