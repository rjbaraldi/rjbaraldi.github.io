<p> I'm a current John von Neumann Postdoctoral Fellow at Sandia National Labs, working with <a href="https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?dpkouri">Drew Kouri</a> and others in the Optimization & Uncertainty Quantification group at SNL.
    My primary focus is developing algorithms for non-smooth, non-convex problems in optimization.
    I finished my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington under <a href="https://uw-amo.github.io/saravkin/">Aleksandr Aravkin</a>.
    I have had the pleasure of working with great collaborators, including but not limited to:
     <a href="https://dpo.github.io/">Dominique Orban</a>;
     <a href="https://math.gmu.edu/~hantil/">Harbir Antil</a>;
     <a href="https://dsrim.github.io/">Donsub Rim</a>;
     <a href="https://shapero.xyz/">Daniel Shapero</a>;
     <a href="https://mjzahr.github.io/">Matthew Zahr</a>;
     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/">Randall LeVeque</a>;
     <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/sven-leyffer">Sven Leyffer</a>; and,
     <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/stefan-m-wild">Stefan Wild</a>.
    I'm also a <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">DOE CSGF alumni</a>.

Apart from that, I run for <a href="https://www.clubnorthwest.org/">Club Northwest</a> and play guitar when I can.
