<!-- # Header one -->

<!-- ## Running -->
I spend a lot of time moving around in straight or slightly curved lines, or on the street in perhaps too-short courses. I'm an active member of [Club Northwest](https://www.clubnorthwest.org/) and previously [Duke's Track Club](https://www.dukestrackclub.com). As a member, I help out with local races and occasionally travel places to race for them around the country (and occasionally in Canada). See Strava [here](https://www.strava.com/athletes/46169578).

<!-- ## Blockquotes -->

<!-- Single line blockquote:

> Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.

## Music
I spend a lot of time listening to music, playing guitar, and going to concerts, so I figured I should include some stuff about that here.
  * I used to DJ for the UW student radio station; support them here [Rainy Dawg Radio](https://rainydawg.org/).
  * I play a lot of guitar when I can. Here's some of the gear I use (for those interested).
      * Taylor SB2-S double cutaway solid body
      * Gretsch Nashville G6121 solid body
       * Line 6 Pre-amp
      * Whammy! pedal
      * Boss SYB-5 bass synthesizer
      * Kustom Defender V5
      * Fender Frontman (because everyone has one of these)
