abstract = { Abstract. We propose and analyze a numerical algorithm for solving a class of optimal control problems for learning-informed semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Such PDEs contain constituents that are in principle unknown and are approximated by nonsmooth ReLU neural networks. We first show that direct smoothing of the ReLU network with the aim of using classical numerical solvers can have disadvantages, such as potentially introducing multiple solutions for the corresponding PDE. This motivates us to devise a numerical algorithm that treats directly the nonsmooth optimal control problem, by employing a descent algorithm inspired by a bundle-free method. Several numerical examples are provided and the efficiency of the algorithm is shown. }

abstract = { Variable projection solves structured optimization problems by completely minimizing over a subset of the variables while iterating over the remaining variables. Over the past 30 years, the technique has been widely used, with empirical and theoretical results demonstrating both greater efficacy and greater stability compared to competing approaches. Classic examples have exploited closed-form projections and smoothness of the objective function. We extend the approach to problems that include nonsmooth terms, develop an inexact adaptive algorithm that solves projection subproblems inexactly by iterative methods, and analyze its computational complexity. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the adaptive algorithm with numerical examples. Code to reproduce the examples is available at ŭlhttps://github.com/TristanvanLeeuwen/VarProNS. }

abstract = "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are effective in solving inverse problems based on differential and integro-differential equations with sparse, noisy, unstructured, and multi-fidelity data. PINNs incorporate all available information, including governing equations (reflecting physical laws), initial-boundary conditions, and observations of quantities of interest, into a loss function to be minimized, thus recasting the original problem into an optimization problem. In this paper, we extend PINNs to parameter and function inference for integral equations such as nonlocal Poisson and nonlocal turbulence models, and we refer to them as nonlocal PINNs (nPINNs). The contribution of the paper is three-fold. First, we propose a unified nonlocal Laplace operator, which converges to the classical Laplacian as one of the operator parameters, the nonlocal interaction radius δ goes to zero, and to the fractional Laplacian as δ goes to infinity. This universal operator forms a super-set of classical Laplacian and fractional Laplacian operators and, thus, has the potential to fit a broad spectrum of data sets. We provide theoretical convergence rates with respect to δ and verify them via numerical experiments. Second, we use nPINNs to estimate the two parameters, δ and α, characterizing the kernel of the unified operator. The strong non-convexity of the loss function yielding multiple (good) local minima reveals the occurrence of the operator mimicking phenomenon, that is, different pairs of estimated parameters could produce multiple solutions of comparable accuracy. Third, we propose another nonlocal operator with spatially variable order α(y), which is more suitable for modeling wall-bounded turbulence, e.g. turbulent Couette flow. Our results show that nPINNs can jointly infer this function as well as δ. More importantly, these parameters exhibit a universal behavior with respect to the Reynolds number, a finding that contributes to our understanding of nonlocal interactions in wall-bounded turbulence."

    abstract = "{Many optimization problems are characterized by expensive objective and/or constraint function evaluations paired with a lack of derivative information. Direct search methods such as generating set search (GSS) are well understood and efficient for derivative-free optimization of unconstrained and linearly constrained problems. This paper presents a study of heuristic algorithms that address the more difficult problem of general nonlinear constraints where derivatives for objective or constraint functions are unavailable. We focus on penalty methods that use GSS to solve a sequence of linearly constrained problems, numerically comparing different penalty functions. A classical choice for penalizing constraint violations is ℓ22, the squared ℓ2 norm, which has advantages for derivative-based optimization methods. In our numerical tests, however, we show that exact penalty functions based on the ℓ1, ℓ2, and ℓ∞ norms converge to good approximate solutions more quickly and thus are attractive alternatives. Unfortunately, exact penalty functions are nondifferentiable and consequently degrade the final solution accuracy, so we also consider smoothed variants. Smoothed-exact penalty functions are attractive because they retain the differentiability of the original problem. Numerically, they are a compromise between exact and , i.e., they converge to a good solution somewhat quickly without sacrificing much solution accuracy. Moreover, the smoothing is parameterized and can potentially be adjusted to balance the two considerations. Since our focus is on optimization problems that are characterized by expensive function evaluations, reducing the number of function evaluations is paramount, and the numerical results of this paper suggest that exact and smoothed-exact penalty functions are well-suited to this task.}",

  abstract    = {The CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition is a leading method for the analysis of multiway data. The standard alternating least squares algorithm for the CP decomposition (CP-ALS) involves a series of highly overdetermined linear least squares problems. We extend randomized least squares methods to tensors and show the workload of CP-ALS can be drastically reduced without a sacrifice in quality. We introduce techniques for efficiently preprocessing, sampling, and computing randomized least squares on a dense tensor of arbitrary order, as well as an efficient sampling-based technique for checking the stopping condition. We also show more generally that the Khatri-Rao product (used within the CP-ALS iteration) produces conditions favorable for direct sampling. In numerical results, we see improvements in speed, reductions in memory requirements, and robustness with respect to initialization.},

@inbook{HAntil_MHeinkenschloss_DCSorensen_2013a,
	abstract = {Projection based methods lead to reduced order models (ROMs) with dramatically reduced numbers of equations and unknowns. However, for nonlinear or parametrically varying problems the cost of evaluating these ROMs still depends on the size of the full order model and therefore is still expensive. The Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) further approximates the nonlinearity in the projection based ROM. The resulting DEIM ROM nonlinearity depends only on a few components of the original nonlinearity. If each component of the original nonlinearity depends only on a few components of the argument, the resulting DEIM ROM can be evaluated efficiently at a cost that is independent of the size of the original problem. For systems obtained from finite difference approximations, the ith component of the original nonlinearity often depends only on the ith component of the argument. This is different for systems obtained using finite element methods, where the dependence is determined by the mesh and by the polynomial degree of the finite element subspaces. This paper describes two approaches of applying DEIM in the finite element context, one applied to the assembled and the other to the unassembled form of the nonlinearity. We carefully examine how the DEIM is applied in each case, and the substantial efficiency gains obtained by the DEIM. In addition, we demonstrate how to apply DEIM to obtain ROMs for a class of parameterized system that arises, e.g., in shape optimization. The evaluations of the DEIM ROMs are substantially faster than those of the standard projection based ROMs. Additional gains are obtained with the DEIM ROMs when one has to compute derivatives of the model with respect to the parameter.},

  abstract = {Nonconvex and nonsmooth problems have recently received considerable attention in signal/image processing, statistics and machine learning. However, solving the nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems remains a big challenge. Accelerated proximal gradient (APG) is an excellent method for convex programming. However, it is still unknown whether the usual APG can ensure the convergence to a critical point in nonconvex programming. In this paper, we extend APG for general nonconvex and nonsmooth programs by introducing a monitor that satisfies the sufficient descent property. Accordingly, we propose a monotone APG and a nonmonotone APG. The latter waives the requirement on monotonic reduction of the objective function and needs less computation in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide APG-type algorithms for general nonconvex and nonsmooth problems ensuring that every accumulation point is a critical point, and the convergence rates remain O(1/k2) when the problems are convex, in which k is the number of iterations. Numerical results testify to the advantage of our algorithms in speed.},
