Here is a short list of projects I've been involved with in the past or am currently working on. Note that complete publication history (with detailed citations) is located in my [CV]({{ rjbaraldi.github.io }}/assets/websitefiles/Personal/website_tex/resume/cv.pdf). Overall, much of my work is currently directed towards solving PDE-constrained optimization problems, especially with regards to solving nonsmooth and nonconvex problems. In the past, I've also worked on uncertainty quantification for biological models.
