[Here]({{ rjbaraldi.github.io }}/assets/websitefiles/Personal/website_tex/bibliography/biblio.pdf) is a short list of projects I've been involved with in the past or am currently working on.
Note that complete publication history (with detailed citations) is located in my [CV]({{ rjbaraldi.github.io }}/assets/websitefiles/Personal/website_tex/CV/cv.pdf)
or [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B36rCJwAAAAJ&hl=enhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B36rCJwAAAAJ&hl=en).
Overall, much of my work is currently directed towards solving PDE-constrained optimization problems, especially with regards to solving nonsmooth and nonconvex problems.
In the past, I've also worked on uncertainty quantification for biological models.
